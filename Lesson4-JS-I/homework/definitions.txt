Variables :
    Variables can be anything -  numbers, text, groups of text and/or numbers. Variables are like assigning
    a code word to a piece of information. For example, we can assign George Washington to the variable firstPrez. SO, rather than
    write out George's full name, we can just write fristPrez and the computer will know what we're talking about.

Strings :
  Strings are pieces of information that are words. We're not going to use them to do math. Like your name. That's a string. We're not going
  to need to do anything like divide or multiply your name.

Functions (arguments, `return`) :
  Functions are little packages of code. Any information that your function needs to run will be entered as an argument. What you
  get out of the function will come out through the 'return' statement. For example - say you want to write a function that outs your first name and
  last name together. The function will need your first and last name - your arguments. The function will run and your return statement will
  return you full name.
      function(firstName, lastName) {
      return(firstName + ' ' + lastName);
      }

`if` statements :
  If statements bits of code that run - if - a condition is met. Like, "If I get all A's, I get a tattoo". If the condition is not met, the code
  doesn't run. For example,

    var grade = A;
    if (grade == A) {
    return('tattoo');
    }

  My grade is grade is A (see the variable above the if statement). The variable grade is equal to (==) A, the statement is true. So 'tattoo' is returned.
  If the variable of grade was equal to B, then grade == A would not be true and it would not return 'tattoo'.

    And the opposite side of that, we can write an if statement like this -

    if (grade != A) {
    return 'grounded';
    }

  This if statement says that if grade is NOT EQUAL (!=) A, then return 'grounded'. If the variable grade is A, then this won't run. We won't
  be grounded. If the variable grade is equal to anything other than A, then - :( - we're 'grounded'.

Boolean values (`true`, `false`):
  Boolean values compare two values and let you know if the statement is true or false. Your answer will always be true or false.
    == EQUAL T0
      4 == 4 : true
      4 == 5 : false
      'Abi' == 'Abi' : true
      'Abi' == 'Awesome' : false
    != NOT EQUAL TO
      4 != 4: false
      4 != 5: true
      'Abi' != 'Abi' : false
      'Abi' != 'Awesome' : true

    You can similarly compare values with less than (<), greater than (>), less than or equal to (<=), and greater than or equal to (>=).
